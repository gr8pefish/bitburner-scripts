Misc:
- cleanup mirroring (remove local files?)


Scripts:
- ram pool
    - global instance w/ updates

- earlygame ram-efficient scripts (e.g. batching, xp)

- pservs

- more utils
    - always backdoor when possible? need singularity?
    - list of server args as option, standardize somehow, even if w/ optional flags
    - better logging, logging class even
        - react windows
- continue general cleanup, incl. naming conventions (e.g. shareAll) + file dirs


Eventually:
- full batcher w/ formulas (jit?)

- eventual: stats/data for each server, for optimizations

- types for string | Server, for autoconvert to name and pass in ram efficient type (whatever I have)
