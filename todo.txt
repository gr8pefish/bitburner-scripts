Misc:

Scripts:
- way better prep script (protobatch it w/ wgw simul)
- improve + debug xp script (w/ targets & w/ minimize ram takeup)
- ram pool
    - global instance w/ updates
- more utils
    - list of server args as option, standardize somehow, even if w/ optional flags
- better logging, logging class even
- early game script automation
- full batcher w/ formulas (jit?)
- eventual: stats/data for each server, for optimizations
- fix killAll arg

- types for string | Server, for autoconvert to name and pass in ram efficient type (whatever I have)
